# scoreboard

Using foundational knowledge of JavaScript I created a basic basketball scoreboard which will display both the HOME and AWAY teams score. Under each display there are 3 buttons each incrementing the score by +1, +2, or +3. Each of these buttons have an onclick listener 3 unique functions for the home team and 3 unique functions for the away team.

Each function for the homeTeam will only increment and display the score for that team and vise versca. The two different displays will host the values for each team's score.

I found an import for a 60's scoreboard font online that I used to recreate the look of an old school scoreboard, I used text-shadow to create the illusion that the text was glowing similar to how to lights glow on an actual scoreboard.
